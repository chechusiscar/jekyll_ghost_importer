In the popular Sunday School story, God appeared to Moses in a burning bush (Exodus 3:1-10).</li><li>At first, Moses had many reservations about the call, even telling God to “please send someone else” (Exodus 4:13).</li><li>Like Moses, God has called us to fulfill certain assignments in life (family, career, business, etc), and we want to accomplish them in Jesus’ Name.&nbsp;</li><li>So today, we’ll look at how God responds to Moses’ reservations/excuses, which happen to parallel the same excuses we typically make when presented with these great dreams, goals, and plans God plants in our hearts.</li></ul>",
